NAME
    CHI::Driver::BerkeleyDB -- Using BerkeleyDB for cache

SYNOPSIS
        use CHI;

        my $cache = CHI->new(
            driver     => 'BerkeleyDB',
            root_dir   => '/path/to/cache/root'
        );

DESCRIPTION
    This cache driver uses Berkeley DB files to store data. Each namespace
    is stored in its own db file.

CONSTRUCTOR OPTIONS
    root_dir
        Path to the directory that will contain the database files, also
        known as the BerkeleyDB "Home".

    Any other constructor options not recognized by CHI are passed along to
    BerkeleyDB::Manager->new. For example, you can pass *db_class* to change
    from the default BerkeleyDB::Hash.
