NAME
    CHI::Driver::BerkeleyDB -- Using BerkeleyDB for cache

SYNOPSIS
        use CHI;

        my $cache = CHI->new(
            driver     => 'BerkeleyDB',
            root_dir   => '/path/to/cache/root'
        );

DESCRIPTION
    This cache driver uses Berkeley DB files to store data. Each namespace
    is stored in its own db file.

    By default, the driver configures the Berkeley DB environment to use the
    Concurrent Data Store (CDS), making it safe for multiple processes to
    read and write the cache without explicit locking.

CONSTRUCTOR OPTIONS
    root_dir
        Path to the directory that will contain the Berkeley DB environment,
        also known as the "Home".

    db_class
        BerkeleyDB class, defaults to BerkeleyDB::Hash.

    env Use this Berkeley DB environment instead of creating one.

    db  Use this Berkeley DB object instead of creating one.
